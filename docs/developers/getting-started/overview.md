title: Getting Started as a RadGrad Developer
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Hey there!  If you are reading this page, you are probably a new RadGrad developer.  Thanks for joining the team!  We hope you enjoy your time working with us. Here's our approach to "onboarding":

## 1. Review the documentation

The first thing to do as a new developer is to read through this entire site. You want to get a sense for the entire project.  As you read, you will have questions. You will post your comments and questions as a comment to a GitHub issue. We want to know what is confusing or unclear in our documentation so we can fix it. As a new developer, you are best suited to let us know when we didn't write clearly.

Please document your outcomes from this task as part of [Issue 465](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/465).

## 2. Review the system from the user perspective

Next, please review the system from the perspective of a user.  If you don't have an account, as Cam or Philip to create one.

Then, use the site and write an essay discussing your findings as detailed in [Issue 464](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/466).  Your essay has the potential to guide development priorities for the next several months, so please take care and do a good job!

## 3. Set up and review the RadGrad tech stack

The second thing to do is to become familiar with the RadGrad tech stack, which is documented in the next section, [Tech Stack](./tech-stack). If you've had ICS 314, Software Engineering, then most of this tech stack should be at least a little familiar to you.  If not, then depending on your background, you may have a few weeks of self-study before you are ready for actual RadGrad development. That's OK!  Please don't cut corners and, for example, use your preferred editor rather than IntelliJ IDEA.  We all understand that this is tremendously enticing, but it will only work against you in the end. We would rather have you be a little slower at the start while you are learning our tech stack, then to try to rush into things, because we've learned through experience that if we all use the same tools, we can help each other better, and we can make the tools work better than if we all go our own way. Once again, we expect you'll have questions as you work with our tech stack. Don't worry!  Just post your questions to the #radgrad2-chat channel on the RadGrad discord server, and we'll help you out.

Please document your outcomes from this task as part of [Issue 466](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/466).

## 4. Download and install RadGrad

The third thing to do is to download and install RadGrad locally, as documented in [How to install RadGrad](./howto/install-radgrad). As part of that, you will want to run the system, as documented in [How to run start scripts](./howto/run-scripts). You also need to learn how to run the tests, as documented in [Overview of RadGrad Testing](../testing/overview).

Please document your outcomes from this task as part of [Issue 467](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/467).

## 5. Build a simple page

The final onboarding task is to build a simple page. This task will get you familiar with the basics of the RadGrad system, its user interface, and internal processing.

For detailed instructions, please see [Issue 468](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/468).
