title: Getting Started with RadGrad Development
sidebar_label: Overview
---

This section provides documentation for new developers on how to get started doing development on RadGrad.

RadGrad development is based heavily on the skills and tech stack used in ICS 314, Introduction to Software Engineering. If you have not taken this course, then you might find it useful to review some of the material:

For information on Javascript, please review the modules [JS 1: Basics](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/javascript-1/), [JS 2: Object Orientation](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/javascript-2/), and/or [JS 3: Functional Programming](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/javascript-3/).

For information on git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop, please review the [Configuration Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/configuration-management/) module.

For information on our tech stack for front-end design, please review the modules on [Semantic UI](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/ui-frameworks/) and [React](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/react/).

For information on our development process, called "Issue Driven Project Management", please review the [Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/project-management/) module.

By far the most complicated aspect of our tech stack is Meteor. ICS 314 splits the material up into three modules: [Meteor 1](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/meteor-1/), [Meteor 2](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/meteor-2/), and [Meteor 3](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/modules/meteor-3/). That said, if you have prior experience with web application development, you might want proceed as follows:

  * Begin to by watching [Meteor: The Fundamentals (30 minutes)](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/morea/meteor-1/reading-screencast-meteor-fundamentals.html), which provides a high level overview of Meteor and what makes it different from other web application frameworks.

  * The [five screencasts associated with Meteor Application Template React (total 75 minutes)](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/#screencasts) provide an overview of the basic structure of a Meteor application and best practices we employ.

  * The [35 minute screencast explaining meteor-example-form-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-example-form-react/#screencast) explains how to use Uniforms and React to create forms and populate the database with user information.

  * The [two hours of screencasts explaining the BowFolios system](https://bowfolios.github.io/#walkthrough-videos) provides a more "real world" example of Meteor, although still much less complicated than RadGrad.

  * Finally, don't forget that the authoritative source on Meteor is the [Meteor Guide](https://guide.meteor.com/). It's worth spending an hour or two reading relevant sections of the Guide, including [Application Structure](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html), [Collections and Schemas](https://guide.meteor.com/collections.html), [Publications and Data Loading](https://guide.meteor.com/data-loading.html), and [Methods](https://guide.meteor.com/methods.html).
