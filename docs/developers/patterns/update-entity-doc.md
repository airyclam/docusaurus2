title: Updating Entity Doc
---

## Problem

We want a form for the user to update an entity in one of our Collections.

Currently, we have several solutions: `imports/ui/components/admin/datamodel/user/UpdateUserForm.tsx`, `imports/ui/components/student/reviews/EditReviewButton.tsx`, `imports/ui/components/advisor/manage/EditStudentButton.tsx`, etc.

## Solution

### 1. Create the AutoForm SimpleSchema

### 2. Update the Entity Doc to Support the AutoForm SimpleSchema

### 3. Create the Modal with the AutoForm
