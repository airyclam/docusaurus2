title: Deploy a release
---

A RadGrad release contains two services: RadGrad (the Meteor application), and MongoDB (the backend database system).

Deployment is the process of bringing up these services on a production server.

We utilize [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage deployment.

We publish the Docker Image for the RadGrad service to the [RadGrad organization at DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/radgrad).

:::warning
Windows-based deployment is not supported.

## Initial setup

When configuring a production server for the first time, you'll want to do the following:

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

First, install Docker and Docker Compose on your production server.

Please consult the [Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [Docker Compose installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for instructions.

### Clone radgrad-docker

Next, clone the [radgrad-docker repository](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad-docker) with `git clone https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad-docker.git`.

### Create config/settings.production.json

Your local radgrad-docker directory contains a subdirectory called "sample-config" containing a sample settings.production.json file called "sample.settings.production.json".

In order for RadGrad to deploy successfully, it expects to a file called "settings.production.json" in a directory named "config".

To setup this directory and file using sample.settings.production.json as a template, execute the following commands:

```shell
$ mkdir config
$ cp -R sample-config/* config
$ mv config/sample.settings.production.json config/settings.production.json
```

:::caution
More details on settings.production.json setup needed.

## Bring up services

Now, cd into the top-level directory, where you should find a script called `docker-compose-run.sh`.  To make it executable, invoke:

```
$ chmod 775 docker-compose-run.sh
```

Invoke it with:

```
$ ./docker-compose-run.sh
```

This will download all the latest official public images for the two RadGrad services, and run them.  The output should look like this:

```
$ ./docker-compose-run.sh

## Verify installation

Invoke the `docker ps` command to verify that all RadGrad containers are running. It should look similar to this:

```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                   NAMES

8f7f92bf2a56        mongo:4.0.5                                "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   12 minutes ago      Up 12 minutes       127.0.0.1:27017->27017/tcp                                                                              opq-radgrad_mongo_1
```

In addition, you should also check the RadGrad service by opening up your web browser and going to http://production-server:8888.

## Update to a new release

To update to a new release, cd to the opq-docker directory on your production server and invoke:

```shell
$ git pull origin master
```

This updates the .env file to specify the new version of the RadGrad (or MongoDB) release.

To restart the services with the updated release, invoke:

```shell
$ ./docker-compose-run.sh
```
