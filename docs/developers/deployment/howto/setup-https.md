title: Setup HTTPS
---

Although the RadGrad application is available over HTTP on port 8888, with a few simple steps, you can easily request
SSL certificates for your domain (from Let's Encrypt) and have your application running over HTTPS instead.

As part of your RadGra installation, we include the `nginx` and `certbot` services to handle the legwork of setting
up HTTPS. More specifically, an Nginx web server on port 80 is automatically configured to forward HTTP traffic to an
HTTPS web server on port 443, which subsequently reverse proxies traffic to the RadGrad application on port 8888.

As such, please make sure that your host machine has port 80 and 443 open to the outside world. It is also recommended
that you setup a firewall on port 8888 once you have HTTPS up and running, otherwise the View application will still
be accessible over HTTP on port 8888.

## Modify the nginx.env configuration file

To begin, you will need to modify some of the configuration variables in the `opq-docker/config/nginx/nginx.env` file.
This configuration file should have already been copied over from the `sample-config` directory earlier during the OPQ
Cloud setup process.

This file contains a few variables that you will need to modify. It looks like this:

```shell
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=example.org
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=user@example.org
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE=1
```

Modify the `NGINX_SERVER_NAME` variable with the domain name pointing to your host machine.

Then, modify the `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` variable with an email address that should be associated with the SSL certificate
generated for the given domain name.

Leave the `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE` variable set to `1` for the time being. This will ensure that you do not hit any
certificate request limit while testing your HTTPS configuration.

Your `nginx.env` file should now look something like this:

```shell
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=emilia.ics.hawaii.edu
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@openpowerquality.org
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE=1
```

## Perform a test run with LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE = 1

Before we begin, ensure that all OPQ Cloud services are shut down by changing into the `opq-docker` directory and
invoking `docker-compose down`.

Then, invoke the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script and follow the prompts. It should look something like this:

```shell
opquser@emilia:~/opq-docker$ ./init-letsencrypt.sh
Existing data found for emilia.ics.hawaii.edu. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N) y

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/emilia.ics.hawaii.edu/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/emilia.ics.hawaii.edu/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2019-06-29. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"

Now, verify that the (fake) SSL certificate was properly generated by opening up your web browser and
visiting your View application at the domain name that you specified. Each web browser application should have a way
to display the SSL certificates of the web site being visited. On Chrome, it should look similar to this:

#### Request real SSL certificate with LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE = 0

Now that everything looks good, we can now go ahead and request a real SSL certificate!

First, shut down all OPQ Cloud services by changing into the `opq-docker` directory and invoking `docker-compose down`.

Then, open the `opq-docker/config/nginx/nginx.env` file and set the `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE` variable to `0`.
The file should now look something like this:

```shell
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=emilia.ics.hawaii.edu
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@openpowerquality.org
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE=0
```

Finally, invoke the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script and follow the prompts. The output should be nearly identical to
that of the test run that was performed earlier:

```shell
opquser@emilia:~/opq-docker$ ./init-letsencrypt.sh
Existing data found for emilia.ics.hawaii.edu. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N) y
