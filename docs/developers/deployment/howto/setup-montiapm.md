title: Setup Monti APM
---

We use [Monti APM](https://montiapm.com/) for application monitoring.

To setup Monti APM, you will need to provide credentials in the settings.json file in the "monti" section.

Monti APM provides useful metrics for performance optimization, as well as logging client and server side run-time errors.

Here is a screenshot of one of the Monti APM screens:
