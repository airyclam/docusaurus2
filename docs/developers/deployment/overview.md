Deployment is the process by which a development version of RadGrad is moved into production.

For RadGrad1, we use [Galaxy](https://www.meteor.com/hosting) to host the Meteor application and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to host the MongoDB database.

For RadGrad2, we are exploring alternatives.  Our current idea is to use Docker and a self-managed Unix server located in the ICS Department, based upon our prior experience with [Open Power Quality Docker-based Deployment](https://openpowerquality.org/docs/cloud-docker.html).

The following pages in this section document the approach we are pursuing for RadGrad2.
