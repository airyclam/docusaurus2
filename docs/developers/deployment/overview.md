Deployment is the process by which a development version of RadGrad is moved into production.

For RadGrad1, we use [Galaxy](https://www.meteor.com/hosting) to host the Meteor application and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to host the MongoDB database.

For RadGrad2, we are using [Meteor Up](http://meteor-up.com/).
