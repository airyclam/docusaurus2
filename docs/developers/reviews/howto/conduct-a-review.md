Steps for conducting a review:

### Preparation

  * The moderator selects the files to review.
  * The moderator creates the review issue on GitHub.
  * The moderator creates a branch with the name 'review-XXX', where the XXX is the review issue number.
  * The moderator assigns the reviewers to the review issue.
    
### Review
  * The reviewers review the code noting issues in the review issue comments with checkboxes.

### Review meeting
  * The moderator and reviews meet to discuss the issues found. The moderator records any improvements to the review process, design patterns or development process.
  * At the conclusion of the review meeting a developer is assigned to fix the issues in the code. The developer might be tasked with updating the RadGrad documentation.

### Closing the Review
  * When the developer is done fixing the code they tell the moderator. The moderator does a quick check then closes the review issue.
