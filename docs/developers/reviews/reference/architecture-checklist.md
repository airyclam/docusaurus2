Practices concerning the file-level organization of the code.

**Arch-01: Obey file name conventions.**

Are files named according to our standards? See [Source Code Organization](../../getting-started/concepts/source-code-organization).

**Arch-02: Obey directory structure.**

Are files located in the appropriate directory? See [Source Code Organization](../../getting-started/concepts/source-code-organization).

**Arch-03: Are new directories consistent with existing directories?**

See [Source Code Organization](../../getting-started/concepts/source-code-organization).
