Javascript and Typescript best practices.

## Javascript

**JS-01:** Do variables/functions/modules conform to our naming standards? (Consistent casing, etc.)

**JS-02:** Do variables/functions/modules have descriptive names?

**JS-03:** Can you use the spread operator?

**JS-04:** Can you use object deconstruction?

**JS-05:** Can you use arrow functions?

**JS-06:** Can you use a built-in function rather than the lodash version?

**JS-07:** Are there any unecessary console.logs?


## Typescript

**TS-01:** Can we change the type `any` to something more specific?

**TS-O2:** Are you using the React.FC type parameterized with the props to express the type of a React component?

## ESLint

**ESLINT-01:** Are there ESLint errors or warnings that should be removed?

**ESLINT-02:** Should we be modifying the set of ESLint rules?
