Reviews in RadGrad serve several purposes:

  1. Improve the quality of the RadGrad codebase.
  2. Educate our developers on best practices.
  3. Develop additional best practices and design patterns.

We are using a simple review process that has several roles:

  * **Moderator** The moderator sets up the review, choosing what code is under review. They create the review issue and moderate the review meeting.

  * **Reviewer** The reviewers step through the code recording issues in the review issue comments. Their responsibilities are to find issues with the code and learn from the code.

  * **Developer** The developer is responsible for fixing the issues found in the review.
