By "RadGrad UI Theme", we mean the presentational or display aspects of the RadGrad user interface.  This includes elements like typography, sizes, colors, and layouts.

The purpose of this chapter is to document two things:

  1. How the RadGrad UI theme is implemented.
  2. Standards for the RadGrad UI that should be preserved throughout the user interface.
