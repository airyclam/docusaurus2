For CSExplore to provide a compelling experience to high school students, it needs to have an interesting user experience. Let's call this the "organizing principle".  It can't simply be a kind of wikipedia site of local resources for computer science; that would be too boring.

The purpose of this page is to document our exploration of ideas for the "organizing principle", or global user experience for CSExplore.

## Augmented Reality

CSExplore could provide an augmented reality UI.  For example, similar to Pokemon Go, the interface could overlay the student's current camera with objects related in some fashion to computer science concepts or careers.

## Scavenger Hunt/Geo Caching

[Geo Caching](https://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=e9c9ddbe-de75-4334-9b4c-4ba90f333715) is a kind of scavenger hunt. Could we organize CS experiences to reward students for physically moving around Honolulu to various locations?

We could have some "caches" be meetups, so they only exist for an hour or so on the map.
