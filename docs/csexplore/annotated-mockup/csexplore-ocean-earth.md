## Author's Notes
Below, I'm going to present 3 different approaches to a CSExplore mockup. When I think of exploration, I immediately see nature. All of these mockups attempt to infuse an aspect of Hawaii's nature with Computer Science.

This mockup was designed with middle schoolers in mind. I commissioned local artist and ICS alumni [Mariah Gaorian](https://www.instagram.com/mjgarts/) to make some graphics that would combine elements of Hawaii, marine life and Computer Science.
