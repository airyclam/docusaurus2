## Organizing Principles
The main target of "Find the right path to Computer Science" mobile app is all high school students in Hawaii.  A lack of understanding about Computer Science is one of the reasons many students don't choose to pursue computer science. The main organizing principle of the app is to encourage students to develop computer science skills and interests by connecting them with opportunities in the local CS field.

## Pedagogical goals
1.	To introduce computer science in innovative and effective ways.
2.	To expand access to Computer Science in high schools 
3.	To increase student interest and participation in Computer Science.
4.	To inform CS related opportunities (i.e. careers, college course, scholarships, events, workshops) in Hawaii
5.	To help high school students to obtain hands-on experiences in Computer Science
6.	To provide a platform to show projects and share ideas.

## Walkthrough of the mockup

 “Exploring the Ocean” is the main theme of the app. The main color scheme is blue. I used bright colors and ocean creature clipart to attract teenagers. Two sets of menus are displayed on the top (CS Subjects, Opportunities, Events) and bottom (Home, Projects, My Page, Alerts, Friends) of the app.
 
 (The above image includes 5 mockups from left to right.)
 
### 1. Intro Page
This is the page when users open the app for the first time. It has a short description about the purpose of this app and sign-up/log-in buttons for the next step. If necessary, we could add a couple of more landing pages using different backgrounds and explain how to use the app step by step. 

### 2. CS Subjects
This page displays 6 best high interest CS subjects for high school students suggested by [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/). (We could add or edit the topics, as necessary.) I used different colors and sea creature icons for each category. The total number of favorites on each category will help users to know the current trends in Computer Science. 

### 3. CS Subject > Human Computer Interaction
This is a page when a user clicks “Human Computer Interaction” on the CS Subject page. It contains a video about the subject, description, related careers, and college courses. 

### 4. Opportunities
This page will be similar to the RadGrad opportunity page. This page represents a list of opportunities that advisors suggest. (i.e. competitions, internships, workshops, training, summer CS programs, scholarships) Users can save opportunities they select to their page.

### 5. CS Projects
This is a page where a user can post their CS related projects such as robots, websites, apps, games. Users can also view other’s work and leave comments on a project you are viewing. This feature will help high school students to learn active listing and improve their projects. Posting CS college student projects will give an opportunity to learn college courses. 
This project page could be used as a portfolio page which shows their work to public. 


### 6. Notifications
Notification page is important because it helps users to visit the app regularly. It will inform users new updates, features, comments, invites from friends. 

## Research evaluation

Here are some of the research questions we'll want to answer:

1.	How many high school students use the app? And how often do they visit the app?
2.	Is the app distinguishable from other similar sites?
3.	Is the app interactive? Does it allow users to communicate and interactive with it? How many users post projects and communicate with other members using the app?
4.	How many students who use the app go to UH ICS?
5.	Which subjects and projects are found to be most interesting by the users?

## What's next 
The next step is creating a list of content needed based on the design and collecting information. We also need to sort data from RadGrad to fit into high school students.
