Welcome to the RadGrad users guide. This section of the site provides documentation for students who wish to learn to use RadGrad.

The user guide is currently in the form of a series of short YouTube videos about each of the basic RadGrad constructs, plus a longer Getting Started Video that goes through initial setup of the system for new users.
