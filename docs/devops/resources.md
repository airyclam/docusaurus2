## GitHub

  * [radgrad-docker repository](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad-docker). Contains Docker scripts.
  * [RadGrad-Docker project board](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad-docker/projects/1). Manages tasks for RadGrad docker for Summer, 2020.

## Readings

Note that Windows-based Docker is not supported for OPQ, so it will not be supported for RadGrad. Mac or Unix only.

#### Docker

  * [OPQ Docker Documentation](https://openpowerquality.org/docs/cloud-docker.html). The OPQ System contains a component called "OPQ View", which is a Meteor application.  Thus, understanding how OPQ implements its Docker system will (hopefully) get you close to everything you need to know to implement a Docker-based deployment of RadGrad.  You will be writing similar documentation in this site.
  * [opq-docker](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq-docker). Scripts for installing OPQ via Docker.
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Official Docker documentation.
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Mac only.
  * [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/). Introductory course to docker and docker compose.
  * [banjerluke/meteor-dockerfile](https://github.com/banjerluke/meteor-dockerfile). Self contained Meteor dockerfile. Could be useful contrast to the OPQ Meteor dockerfile.
  * [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/). Tutorial to install and use Docker Desktop on Windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2).
  * [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/). Optional. May be necessary to obtain Windows 10 Home 19018(+) for Docker Desktop on Windows.
