## GitHub

  * [radgrad-docker repository](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad-docker). Contains Docker scripts.

## Readings

Note that Windows-based Docker is not supported for OPQ, so it will not be supported for RadGrad. Mac or Unix only.

  * [OPQ Docker Documentation](https://openpowerquality.org/docs/cloud-docker.html). The OPQ System contains a component called "OPQ View", which is a Meteor application.  Thus, understanding how OPQ implements its Docker system will get you close to everything you need to know to implement a Docker-based deployment of RadGrad.  You will be writing similar documentation in this site.
  * [opq-docker](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq-docker). Scripts for installing OPQ via Docker.
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Official Docker documentation.
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Mac only.
