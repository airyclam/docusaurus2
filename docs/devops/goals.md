The DevOps project has the following goals:


**Provide deployment platform choices.** Explore the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and/or other tools in order to host RadGrad on a variety of platforms.

**Improve performance.** Do performance analysis and optimization to see if local hosting of RadGrad can improve responsiveness of the application.
