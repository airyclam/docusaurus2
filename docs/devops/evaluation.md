# STRESS TESTING:
These are the performance tests we should consider. Although this lists a variety of tests,it is crucial to apply a certain weight to criteria most important to the project. [Click here for more info](https://www.cigniti.com/blog/strategy-for-the-performance-testing-in-cloud/)

* Stress test: Stress testing validates the responsiveness, reliability, and stability of the cloud infrastructure under extremely high load. 
* Load test: Load testing ascertains whether or not the system performs optimally when it is being used by multiple users at the same time. 
* Browser testing: This type of testing is critical for determining the compatibility of a browser with the overall system. 
* Latency testing: A latency test is required to measure the time taken for moving data messages between two points within a cloud network. 
* Targeted infrastructure test: In this test, each component or layer of an application is isolated and tested for the ability to deliver the required performance. This test helps uncover any issue that would hamper with the overall system’s performance. 
* Failover test: It determines a system’s ability to call in additional resources when it faces heavy traffic and usage to ensure that the end user’s experience is not affected. 
* Capacity test: This test is essential for identifying and benchmarking the maximum amount of traffic or load that the cloud system can handle effectively. 
* Soak test: Soak testing measures the performance of a system when it is exposed to heavy traffic for an extended duration to validate its behavior in the production environment. 

# THE HOW:

[Here](https://geekflare.com/essential-tools-to-perform-stress-test-online/) are some tools used for stress testing your site. Some are paid, some are free. Certain ones excel at certain topics, so it might be beneficial to consider using a combination of these.
