FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) | New | A field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence the term "field-programmable". 
VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) | New | VHDL is a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays and integrated circuits.
Verilog | New | Verilog, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems.
Software Reverse Engineering | New | Software reverse engineering can help to improve the understanding of the underlying source code for the maintenance and improvement of the software, relevant information can be extracted to make a decision for software development and graphical representations of the code can provide alternate views regarding the source code, which can help to detect and fix a software bug or vulnerabilities.
Circuit Analysis | New | Circuit (Network) Analysis is the process of finding the voltages across, and the currents through, all network components.
Systems | New | In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. In electronics and telecommunications, it refers to any time varying voltage, current or electromagnetic wave that carries information. A signal may also be defined as an observable change in a quality such as quantity.
Microelectronic | New | As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or microfabrication) of very small electronic designs and components. Usually, but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller. These devices are typically made from semiconductor materials
Digital Design (Logic Synthesis) | New | In computer engineering, logic synthesis is a process by which an abstract specification of desired circuit behavior, typically at register transfer level (RTL), is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates, typically by a computer program called a synthesis tool.
