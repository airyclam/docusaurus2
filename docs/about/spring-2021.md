title: Spring 2021 Project Planning
---

There are three projects for Spring, 2020.

## 1. RadGrad2 UI Redesign and Evaluation

The goal of this project is to perform a redesign of the RadGrad2 User Interface and then conduct a pilot study to assess the design.

The team for this project is: Cam, Philip, Rashmi, Hanna.

### UI Redesign

We will redesign the UI in an interative way. After selecting some portion of the UI to focus on, we will proceed as follows:

  1. [3 days] The entire team will perform a UI review of the selected UI subset and come up with a set of improvement proposals.

  2. [4 days] Hanna will create a set of Figma mockups (if needed) to provide a visual indication of the redesign.

  3. [2 days] Mockups are reviewed and either approved or improvement suggestions made.

  3. [7 days] Hanna and/or Rashmi will implement the redesign.

  4. [5 days] The RadGrad2 team will review the implementation and proposal corrections if necessary.

  5. The revised version will be deployed to radgrad2.ics.hawaii.edu.

If the proposed timeline can be satisfied, then the approximate time for one iteration is three weeks. Note that there can be some parallelism: the review of the next portion of the UI could occur in tandem with the implementation of current redesign. So, hopefully, we can actually deploy new redesign portions closer to every two weeks.

### UI Pilot Study

Once the UI is redesigned, we will carry out a pilot study to assess the quality of the UI and reveal opportunities for improvement.

This will also serve as Rashmi's M.S. project.

Details of the experimental design will be determined later. It will involve a small study of approximately one dozen undergraduates.


## 2. RadGrad for Computer Engineering

The goal of this project is to create a new instance of RadGrad2 that is tailored to the needs of the Computer Engineering program.

The team for this project is: Cam, Philip, Jatin.


### RadGrad/CE implementation.

This task involves the creation of a new RadGrad2 instance to be initialized with courses, opportunities, career goals, and interests most appropriate to computer engineering.  The instance will be deployed to a Digital Ocean droplet.

Jatin will be the primary developer of this instance.

As the UI for RadGrad2 is incrementally improved, these changes will be integrated into the RadGrad2/CE instance.

The goal is to have an instance of RadGrad/CE available for evaluation by the end of Spring Break.

### RadGrad/CE evaluation

This task involves a pilot study to assess how well the RadGrad/CE instance addresses the needs of Comp Eng students.

Details of the experimental design will be determined later. It will involve a small study of approximately one dozen undergraduates in Computer Engineering.

It should last just a couple of weeks, and the results written up and published as a technical report.

## 3. RadGrad Quality Improvement

This task involves code review, performance analysis, and code improvement.

The team for this project is: Cam, Philip, and potentially Rashmi if available.
