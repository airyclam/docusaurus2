title: Summer 2021 Internship Opportunities for ICS 414 Students
---

As a Spring 2021 ICS 414 student, you have significant experience with the [RadGrad Tech Stack](../developers/getting-started/tech-stack).

We are looking to hire up to four ICS 414 students to work full-time this summer on RadGrad as part of the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Program. Through this program, you will:

* Contribute to the development of the next generation of RadGrad, called RadGrad2.
* Participate in the design and evaluation of a research project based on RadGrad.
* Further develop your software engineering skills.
* Get paid $600/week between May and August, 2021. (Exact schedule can be somewhat flexible).
* Have a significant professional experience to add to your resume and professional portfolio.

All work will be remote. You do not need to be in Hawaii, though please don't be more than a few timezones away so that it's easy to schedule online meetings.

If you are interested, please send an email before March 1, 2021 to Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu) with a link to your professional portfolio and a short paragraph telling us why you would be interested in working on this project.  For more details about the RadGrad Project, please look through the [documentation](https://www.radgrad.org/docs/overview/motivation).
