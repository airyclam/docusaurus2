The goal of this site is to provide a public repository for documents pertaining to the design, implementation, and evaluation of RadGrad Project systems, including RadGrad2, CSExplore, InternBit, and the RadGrad2 DevOps project.

Documentation for the four projects during Summer 2020 start here:

  * [RadGrad2](../radgrad2/goals)
  * [RadGrad2 DevOps](../devops/goals)
  * [CSExplore](../csexplore/goals)
  * [InternBit](../internbit/goals)

Eventually, this site will replace https://radgrad.org. For now, it can be accessed at https://radgrad.github.io.
