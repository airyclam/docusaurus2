RadGrad2 is a rewrite of the original RadGrad using Typescript, React, and other technologies not present in the original RadGrad.

The goals of RadGrad2 include:

**Simplify maintenance and enhancement**. We will achieve this through a component-based design and architecture.

**Improve reliability and robustness**. We hope to achieve this through type-checking and testing.

**Simplify tailoring**. We will incorporate findings from RadGrad1 to simply adaptation to other departments and organizations.
