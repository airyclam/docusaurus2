title: RadGrad2 Evaluation
sidebar_label: Evaluation

We believe that computer science must develop new and better ways to improve engagement (i.e. create wider interest in pursuing CS), retention (i.e. create mechanisms to improve the chance students, once pursuing a CS undergraduate degree, will complete it), and diversity (i.e. create ways to improve engagement and retention for women and underrepresented minorities).

The fundamental goal of the RadGrad Project is to provide students, faculty, and advisors with an alternative perspective on the undergraduate degree program---which traditionally boils down to a single kind of activity (coursework), and a single metric for success (grade point average). Our alternative perspective is called the Degree Experience, and it gives first class status to both curricular activities (courses) and extracurricular activities (discipline-oriented events, activities, clubs, etc.) To establish the first class status of extracurricular activities, the Degree Experience perspective replaces GPA as the single metric for success with a three component metric called ICE that assesses student development with respect to Innovation, Competency, and Experience. Each student's Degree Experience also includes a representation of their disciplinary interests and career goals that helps them assess the relevance of potential curricular and extracurricular activities. Finally, the Degree Experience perspective is voluntary. It complements but does not change any existing undergraduate degree requirements of a university.

## General Goals of RadGrad2

In no particular order these are the goals of RadGrad2:

* Improve the performance of RadGrad by using React and Typescript.
* Support STEM departments other than ICS at UH Manoa.
* Support other Universities other than UH Manoa.
* Evaluate how well RadGrad improves engagement and retention.

## Evaluating Performance

* Look at the network traffic and see what is taking time.
* Compare RadGrad1 and RadGrad2 load times for similar databases.
* Use the React Profiler to measure the performance of different components. https://blog.bitsrc.io/measure-performance-with-the-new-react-profiler-component-14d3801d232d
* Look at subscriptions.
* Use Performance Tab of Dev Tools

## Evaluating Support for Other Departments

* Develop documentation on how to create a fixture for another STEM department.
* Develop a fixture for another STEM department and document the process.

## Evaluating Support for Other Universities

* Create a standard for uploading data from the registrar. What does RadGrad need for getting student's academic data?

## Evaluating Engagement and Retention
