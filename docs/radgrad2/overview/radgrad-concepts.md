Expanding the students' degree experience from just taking classes and getting a good GPA to preparing them to have a successful career in computer science.

## ICE (Innovation, Competency, Experience)

RadGrad provides "ICE", which provides a simple measure of a student's participation in activities related to innovation, competency, and experience. The ICE user interface also provides a means for students to assess the adequacy of their participation in these three kinds of activities. 

The goal of ICE is to make students aware that innovation and experience are as important as competency to a high quality undergraduate CS education, to provide students and advisors with a new means to  assess gaps in a student's preparation, and to provide students with a sense for a "good" ICE value through the ranking system.
