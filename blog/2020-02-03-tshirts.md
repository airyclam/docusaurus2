We are happy to announce the availability of RadGrad t-shirts for pickup to those students who completed their degree plan in December and filled out the form requesting a tshirt.  Please email radgrad@hawaii.edu if you have not already received an email with instructions on how to pick up your t-shirt. 

Many thanks to RadGrad undergraduate research assistant Mirabela Medallon for the design!
