If you've had ICS 314, Software Engineering, then most of this tech stack should be at least a little familiar to you.  If not, then depending on your background, you may have a few weeks of self-study before you are ready for actual RadGrad development. That's OK!  Please don't cut corners and, for example, use your preferred editor rather than IntelliJ IDEA.  We all understand that this is tremendously enticing, but it will only work against you in the end. We would rather have you be a little slower at the start while you are learning our tech stack, then to try to rush into things, because we've learned through experience that if we all use the same tools, we can help each other better, and we can make the tools work better than if we all go our own way. Once again, we expect you'll have questions as you work with our tech stack. Don't worry!  Just post your questions to the #radgrad2-chat channel on the RadGrad discord server, and we'll help you out."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"The third thing to do is to download and install RadGrad locally, as documented in ",Object(a.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"./howto/install-radgrad"}),"How to install RadGrad"),".
